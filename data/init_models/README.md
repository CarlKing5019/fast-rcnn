- ST_vgg_to_alexnet_hha - supervision transfert from VGG RGB network to train a
AlexNet HHA network. VGG RGB network was first finetuned for detection on NYUD2
trainval set and transfer was conducted over images from NYUD2 trainval video
sequence.
- CaffeNet - trained on ImageNet, from BVLC model zoo
- VGG16 - trained on ImageNet, from BVLC model Zoo
